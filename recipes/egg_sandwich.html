            A delicious microwave egg and cheese sandwich on toast.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>2 slices white bread</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 slice American cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the egg into a microwave-safe cereal bowl and whisk in the milk. Season with salt and pepper. Cook in the microwave on 100% power for 1 to 2 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
            <li>While the egg is cooking, toast the bread. Use a spoon to remove the cooked egg from the bowl and set it on one piece of toast. Top with a slice of cheese and the other piece of toast. Cook in the microwave until cheese is melted, about 15 seconds.</li>
