        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking! I use rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh from your garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dry pasta</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl. Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return the pasta to the pot.</li>
            <li>Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.</li>
        </ol>
